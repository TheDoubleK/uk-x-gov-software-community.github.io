On Wednesday, 29th January 2025, we will be hosting an in-person conference in London, bringing together members of the community for an exciting day of talks, discussions, and networking. 

Whether youâ€™re a seasoned developer or just starting on your career journey, this is the perfect event to meet others from across the government delivering digital services.

## Ticketing Information
This event has a limited capacity. Therefore, to ensure a diverse representation from across government departments, tickets will be allocated in two releases:

* **Release 1**: Registration opens, and everyone will be able to register for the wait list. Tickets will be allocated to the first two people who register from each department/agency.

* **Release 2**: On **1st December**, if there are any remaining spaces, tickets will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis to those on the waiting list, with a maximum of 10 tickets per department/agency.

## Submit your lightning talk

As part of the conference schedule, you have the opportunity to give a 10-minute lightning talk on a topic of your choice. 

If you have an interesting, funny, frustrating or inspiring story from your time working in government, **[please submit a talk title and brief description via our form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPAm-_gH6r9TAXBzsplKvCANWEI3kZJYEmlo2UA-uFs2KdnA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**. We have up to 6 spaces for these 10-minute talks (including optional 5 minutes for questions).

Submissions will be reviewed by the conference organising committee. If your talk is accepted, you will be guaranteed a ticket.

**We look forward to seeing you at the conference!**
